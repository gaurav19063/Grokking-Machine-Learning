# Non Linear SVM using Tensorflow

Non-linear classification of Iris dataset using Support Vector Machines leaveraging the power of Tensorflow.

## DATA DESCRIPTION:
Name : IRIS Dataset
No.of Feature Columns : 4 ['sepal length (cm)','sepal width (cm)','petal length (cm)','petal width (cm)']

**Output:** A Separation line between the two classes

## MODELLING AND EVALUATION:
ML Algorithm used : Support Vector Machine

Metric - Since the target variable is a categorical value, we have used binary crossentropy for the loss metrics.

CONCLUSION:
We have used Support Vector Machine to draw a separation line betweeen the two classes of Iris Dataset with the help of Tensorflow
