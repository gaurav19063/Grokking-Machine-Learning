 the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric machine learning method. It essentially works for classification and regression. 

 Its purpose is to use a database in which the data points are separated into several classes to predict the classification of a new sample point.
 Here, in the iris dataset has been used to train the model. The data was trained in such a fashion that it was organised , balanced ,features and labels were added etc. KNN was eventually used using regularisation. Accuracy was taken care off as well which is the fulcrum of the ML model
